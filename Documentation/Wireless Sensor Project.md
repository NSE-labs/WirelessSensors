# Wireless Sensor Project
The purpose of this project is to develop hardware and software for small wireless sensors. The sensors could be used to monitor parameters such as temperature, humidity, light levels, or actuation of a switch or contact.
## Requirements
1. The sensors should be independent of mains power.
1. The sensors should be able to communicate with either a single-board computer (example: Raspberry Pi) or smartphone, or both.
1. Communication range for the sensors should cover an average house at minimum. Ideally it would cover cases where the sensor may be placed in a greenhouse, chicken coop, or mailbox on the same property.
1. The sensors should be reasonably rugged and protected from moisture, but are not necessarily intended for outdoor mounting or submersion in liquids.
1. The data rate should support a few parameters sent once per minute. High speed data such as audio or video are not required.
1. Size of the sensor could be as large as a college textbook, but smaller is better.
1. Accuracy will vary according to the sensors used. Provisions will need to be made in the packaging to avoid self-heating in the case of temperature sensing.
1. If replaceable batteries are used, battery life should be at least 3 months.
1. If rechargeable batteries are used, battery life should be at least 1 month.
1. It should be possible to run the sensors on solar power by connecting an external solar panel.
